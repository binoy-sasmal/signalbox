# Review log

One row per `/review` invocation of the `gate-reviewer` agent. The agent reads this
file at the start of every review and reports the running tally in its output.

**Why this file rather than agent memory.** Claude Code's subagent `memory` field
would have done the tracking, but enabling it automatically grants the subagent
Read, Write and Edit — which would undo the read-only scoping the agent exists
under. A git-tracked file keeps the reviewer read-only, and has the better property
anyway: it is a diff. Agent memory is opaque, this is not.

**What it cannot see.** It records reviews that happened. It cannot record a review
that was never requested, and that — not a corrupted row — is the realistic failure:
`/review` quietly not being run for six turns during a good stretch. CLAUDE.md
covers that separately, by requiring the builder to state the last review's date,
range and verdict at every gate boundary, and to report the absence of one as the
finding when none has run since the previous gate.

**Written by the builder, read by the reviewer.** The builder appends the row after
each verdict. A builder could omit a REJECT, but the omission is visible in git
history, which is more than opaque memory would offer.

## Format

| Date | Range reviewed | Verdict | Findings | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

- **Date** — ISO date of the review.
- **Range reviewed** — the git range or working-tree scope given to `/review`,
  verbatim. `working tree + HEAD` when invoked with no argument.
- **Verdict** — `ACCEPT`, `ACCEPT WITH AMENDMENTS`, `REJECT`, or `ESCALATE`.
- **Findings** — count, and the rubric item numbers they fell under. `0` if clean.
- **Notes** — one line. For `ESCALATE`, which halt condition fired.
